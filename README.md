# landing-page

This is a dummy webpage created to practice my HTML and CSS skills.

## Disclaimer

This website is viewed most optimally on Google Chrome. Some attributes such as `gap` or `margin`
may not appear correctly on some browsers like Safari.

## Components

It contains five flexbox containers that also may also contain flexbox containers as items themselves.
The main five containers are of class (in order):
<ol>
    <li> header
    <li> content
    <li> quote
    <li> signup
    <li> footer
<ol>

### `header`

The <strong>header<strong> consists of a logo, pseudo-links, text boxes, a looping video and a sign-up `button`. 
Organizing the header improved my flexbox skills as I manipulated the content by using multiple containers.
I also nested the containers to utilize the `flex-direction` attribute and align the content into columns and rows.

### `content`

The <strong>content<strong> container consists of a header text multiple pictures aligned in a row along with
their respective captions. In order to align the captions with their pictures, I created `div` containers
holding the pictures and captions separately.

### `quote`

The <strong>quote<strong> container takes up a fourth of the page and contains only a quote from one of
my favorite movies in cursive font. It has a considerable amount of padding to emohasize the importance of
the quote.

### `signup`

The <strong>signup<strong> container parodies a website asking for visitors to sign-up to their email list
and includes a \*don't\* sign-up `button` similiar to the `button` in the header.

### `footer`

The <strong>footer<strong> only contains the copyright statement. It has the same background color as the header.

## Summary

The `landing-page` helped me practice correctly using HTML anchor tags and strategically nesting them in order
to best stylize them using CSS specificity and the <strong>Box Model<strong>. I can definitely work on naming classes better and chaining containers and items more efficiently.
