# landing-page

This is a dummy webpage created to practice my HTML and CSS skills.

## Disclaimer

This website is viewed most optimally on Google Chrome. Some attributes such as `gap` or `margin`
may not appear correctly on some browsers like Safari.

## Components

It contains five flexbox containers that also may also contain flexbox containers as items themselves.
The main five containers are of class (in order):
<ol>
    <li> header
    <li> content
    <li> quote
    <li> signup
    <li> footer
<ol>

### `header`

### `content`

### `quote`

### `signup`

### `footer`


## Summary

The `landing-page` helped me practice correctly using HTML anchor tags and strategically nesting them in order
to best stylize them using CSS specificity and the <strong>Box Model<strong>. I can definitely work on naming classes better and chaining containers and items more efficiently.
